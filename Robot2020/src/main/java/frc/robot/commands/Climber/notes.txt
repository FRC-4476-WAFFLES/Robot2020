3 motors:
    - all have encoders (talon srx)
    - all are 775 pro (needs current limiting)
    - 1 deploy, 2 winch

There will be a button that deploys to the middle height.
There will be a button that retracts back into the robot.

Winch unspools proportional to the deployment encoder.
Want PID, but when we get pushed too far, we can retract after.
Once retracted, start winching.
Winching is on a button, but a joystick can unwinch to balance.
Probably need a locking mechanism (hopefully automatic when disabled).
